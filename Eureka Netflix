ðŸ›  Steps to use Eureka in your microservices project:


1. Create Eureka Server
This is the "Service Registry" where all your microservices will register.



***********************************************************************************************
a) Create a Spring Boot project (e.g., eureka-server)

Add dependency in pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
</dependency>

***********************************************************************************************
b) Add @EnableEurekaServer annotation

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
***********************************************************************************************

c) Important Configuration Options in application.properties:

# For Eureka Server
server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false

# For Eureka Client (services)
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
eureka.instance.hostname=localhost
eureka.client.healthcheck.enabled=true
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true
eureka.client.fetch-registry=true


âœ… register-with-eureka=false â†’ For the server itself.
âœ… fetch-registry=false â†’ Server doesn't need to pull data from itself.

***********************************************************************************************

âœ… Done! Your Eureka server will be available at http://localhost:8761

ðŸŽ¯ Quick Diagram for better understanding:

[ Payment Service ]         [ Order Service ]          [ User Service ]
       |                           |                          |
       +------------+--------------+-------------+
                                â†“
                       [  Eureka Server  ]


***********************************************************************************************
Eureka is a REST-based service that is primarily used in the microservices architecture for service discovery.
In a distributed system where services can dynamically scale up, down, move across servers, or fail, Eureka acts as a central service registry that allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services dynamically without hardcoding IP addresses or hostnames.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Netflix Eureka Server along with microservices acting as Eureka Clients to build a resilient, scalable, and easily maintainable cloud-native application.

ðŸ“š Eureka Concepts You Should Know:

Concept	Meaning
Registration	Service tells Eureka it exists (with its name, IP, port).
Heartbeat	Every few seconds, the service pings Eureka: "I'm alive!"
Self-preservation mode	If many services seem dead (maybe network issue), Eureka keeps them in registry anyway â€” to avoid false alarms.
Service Discovery	A service can ask Eureka for the address of another service by its name.
Load Balancing	If multiple instances exist, the client picks one (randomly or round-robin).

***********************************************************************************************


Eureka is a Service Discovery Server â€” made by Netflix â€” mainly used in microservices architecture.

In one sentence:
ðŸ‘‰ Eureka helps microservices find and talk to each other automatically without hardcoding IP addresses.

Why is Eureka needed?
In a microservices world:

Services can start, stop, crash, or move between servers.

Hardcoding addresses like http://192.168.1.10:8080 won't work.

You need something dynamic â€” a "middleman" that always knows where services are running.

That's what Eureka does. âœ…

How it works:
Eureka Server â†’ A centralized app where services register themselves (like checking into a hotel).

Eureka Client â†’ A service that registers itself to Eureka and can find other services through Eureka.

When one service needs another, it asks Eureka, not the IPs directly. Eureka returns a list of available instances.

Real-world example:
user-service starts â†’ Registers itself to Eureka.

payment-service starts â†’ Registers itself to Eureka.

order-service wants to talk to payment-service.

It asks Eureka: "Where is payment-service?"

Eureka replies: "Here are the addresses."

order-service picks one and calls it.

No manual tracking. Fully dynamic. ðŸ”¥

Quick analogy:

Real world	Microservices world
Hotel receptionist tells you room numbers	Eureka tells services about other services
Tech Stack Tip:
Spring Boot apps + Eureka = Very common for building scalable systems.

Together with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, you also get load balancing between multiple service instances.
